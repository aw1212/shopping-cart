# shopping-cart

This is a simple spring boot app that takes a `List<Fruit>` and a `List<Offer>` and returns the total cost of the fruit, taking any offers into account. 
The main method is in the CheckoutTill class. You can easily change the number of Oranges or number of Apples that is added to the ShoppingCart by editing the Constants `NUM_APPLES` and `NUM_ORANGES`. You can also play around with the available offers by editing the `OFFERS` Constant.
